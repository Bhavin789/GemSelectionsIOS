We can say that there is four type of gems find Color, Cut, Clarity and Crystal. Emerald (Be3Al2Si6O18) is the grass-green type of Beryl. The formation of emerald involves a natural process known as exometamorphism.\n\nTraditional gemstone for the astrological signs of Taurus, Cancer and sometimes Gemini. One of the quainter anecdotes on emeralds was by the 16th-century historian Brantôme, who referred to the many impressive emeralds the Spanish under Cortez had brought back to Europe from Latin America.\n\nNormally, in the grading of colored gemstones, color is by far the most important criterion. However, in the grading of emerald, crystal is considered a close second. Both are necessary conditions. A fine emerald must possess not only a pure verdant green hue as described below, but also a high degree of transparency to be considered a top gem.\n\nThe Swat emeralds show light red to red through the Chelsea color filter and completely absorb short-wave ultra-violet radiation.\n\nThis gives the rock its gemlike green color. Varying amount of iron also alters the color of the rock. It has a hardness of 7.5-8 and a refractive index of 1.57-1.59.

In Colombian stones, which constitute a high proportion of fine Emeralds used in Jewellery, the most constant features are flat cavities with upper and lower margins jagged like a coarse saw, containing liquid, a bubble of gas, and a little cube of rock salt.\n\nEmeralds from the Sandawana emerald mine in Zimbabwe have played quite an important role in the trade since their discovery in 1956. These are rich in chromium and thus a very deep and vivid green, which seen at its best in small stones.\n\nDark Green Emeralds have recently emanated from Pakistan, and these contain rather indeterminate inclusions, along which flakes of mika and small crystals of phenakite and dolomite could be recognized.\n\nSiberian Emeralds or more commonly known as Russian Emerald is a development of thin, cavities parallel to the basal plane.
